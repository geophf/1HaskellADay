Washington Crossing The Delaware
by David Shulman, (1936)

A hard, howling, tossing water scene. 
Strong tide was washing hero clean. 
"How cold!" Weather stings as in anger. 
O Silent night shows war ace danger!

The cold waters swashing on in rage, 
Redcoats warn slow his hint engage, 
When star general's action wish'd "Go!" 
He saw his ragged continentals row.

Ah, he stands-sailor crew went going. 
And so this general watches rowing. 
He hastens-winter again grows cold. 
A wet crew gain Hessian stronghold.

George can't lose war with's hands in; 
He's astern-so go alight, crew, and win!
