# HAD / (1) Haskell A Day

... geddit? 'HAD'/'Haskell A Day'

So, here are the exercises and solutions for the problems posted on
@1HaskellADay. They are organized by module directory `Y[Year].M[Month].D[Day]`

This directory `HAD` also contains support modules used across exercises. Yes,
some of these scenarii get complex, pulling in multiple common modules, but
so it goes.

Pick an exercise, say: `Y2018.M05.D11.Exercise`, solve it, see how I solved it
(which would be `Y2018.M05.D11.Solution`), then try another exercise. Lather.
Rinse. Repeat. until you get that dream-Haskell job in the sky, or you do
all your programming going forward in Haskell, or you rewrite Haskell to 
Dependently Typed Whitespace, pardon: Forth, pardon: Idris, pardon: Prolog, ...

... okay, one (or several) of those.

Also: you're special, you're enchanting, so: have a nice day.
