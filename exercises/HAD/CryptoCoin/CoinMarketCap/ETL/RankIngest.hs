Hoo, boy! Sparse matrices... Sorry, dense matrices! I remember doing this
stuff with parallel FORTRAN.

We have dates (which are not guaranteed to be consecutive), indices (which are 
also not guaranteed to be consecutive) and rankings (the observed datum).

I'm thinking:

idx,date n, date n-1, date n-2, ..., date 0
1,Just 1, Just 1, ..., Nothing

like that.

This could, I suppose, be represented as a map of maps? *

* It has been, but that is getting to be a huge object file and taking a while
to load. Maybe the CSV is the way to go?

But then let's 'normalize' with Day and Idx

date,idx,vect1,vect2,...,vectn
d1,1,...
d1,2,...
.
.
.
dn,1,...
dn,2,...

where vect is a datum we care about. Then we'll use snarf to materialize our
multimap.

But this CSV has to be a consolidated result of ranks, listings, and FCAS.

FCAS: Fundamental Crypto Asset Score, a single, consistently comparable value 
for measuring cryptocurrency project health

Another advantage of the CSV-approach (or some other data store) is that I
don't have to recompile two programs each time I add information to the 
knowledge base.

HERE'S A THOUGHT! ... or: ON SECOND THOUGHT!

Why don't I just CSV the ranks for now and see what external tools out there
do the job?

HUH!

... on second-second thought: nah. We still want to save our state as 
Haskell-value, and we still want to get a rank-diff of the latest.

so, ... nah on the second thought. Back to the second-second thought, which is
the first thought.

THIS ALSO ASSUMES WE DO THIS ON A DAILY CANDENCE AND DON'T MISS DAYS!
