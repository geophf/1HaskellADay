The CSV file from yesterday has reviews, prices and ratings. I've pulled those,
along with the reviewer and the wine reviewed, into a JSON file here.

wineReviewsDir, wineReviewsJSON :: FilePath
wineReviewsDir = "Y2021/M02/D03/"
wineReviewsJSON = "wine-reviews.json"

But there's a problem.

I mean, yeah, sure, you can look up the node of the reviewer and the wine
reviewed by name each time, but the names aren't indexed ...

... there's a hint and a half for somebody. :/

And even if they were, if you had the indices, PERHAPS the lookup might
be faster?

Perhaps.

So, let's do that.

Given a node-type and an attribute name, return a mapping from the attribute
value (which should be of type Name) to the index.
--}

nodeMapQuery :: Name -> Name -> Cypher
nodeMapQuery node attrib = 
   T.concat ["MATCH (n:", node, ") RETURN n.", attrib,", id(n)"]

type NodeIds = Map Name Idx

nodeMap :: Endpoint -> Name -> Name -> IO NodeIds
nodeMap = undefined

{--
With the nodeMap-function, what are the mappings for the Taster-name's and for
the Wine-title's? How many tasters are there? How many wines?

Okay, let's put those mappings to good use.
--}

data RawReview = Raw { reviewer :: Maybe Name, wine :: Name,
                       reviewtxt, scoreVal :: Text, mbprice :: Maybe Text }
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance FromJSON RawReview where
   parseJSON = undefined

sampJSONnoPrice, sampJSONnoReviewer :: ByteString
sampJSONnoPrice = BL.pack (unlines ["  {",
    "\"reviewer\": \"Roger Voss\", ",
    "\"wine\": \"ChÃ¢teau Rieussec 2011 Carmes de Rieussec  (Sauternes)\",",
    "\"review\": \"2011 was a great year for Sauternes and this...\",",
    "\"score\": \"90\",",
    "\"price\": null"," }"])

sampJSONnoReviewer = BL.pack (unlines ["{",
    "\"reviewer\": null,",
    "\"wine\": \"Jamieson Ranch 2011 Whiplash Chardonnay (California)\",",
    "\"review\": \"$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that ...\",",
    "\"score\": \"86\",",
    "\"price\": \"14\"", "}"])
 
{--
I call this thing a RawReview because there are bunches of things wrong with
it.

Firstly, when the reviewer is not present, replace it with the Name "No Taster"

Also, score and price should be Integer values.

Also-also, the reviewer and the wine should have their indexed values from
above. Please confirm the "No Taster" index.

Give the above caveats, convert the RawReview to a review
--}

data Review = Review { reviewerIx, wineIx :: Idx, review :: Text,
                       score :: Integer, price :: Maybe Integer }
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

rr2r :: NodeIds -> NodeIds -> RawReview -> Review
rr2r = undefined

{--
Now that you have the revised reviews, you can upload the properties to the
review relations.
--}

uploadReviewQuery :: Review -> Cypher
uploadReviewQuery r =
   T.pack (concat ["match (t:Taster)-[r:RATES_WINE]->(w:Wine) ",
                   "where id(t) = ", show (reviewerIx r), " and id(w) = ",
                   show (wineIx r), " SET r += { review: ", show (review r),
                   showPrice (price r), ", score: ", show (score r), " }"])

showPrice :: Maybe Integer -> String
showPrice Nothing = ""
showPrice (Just p) = ", price: " ++ show p

-- upload the reviews, prices and scores to the graph-store.
