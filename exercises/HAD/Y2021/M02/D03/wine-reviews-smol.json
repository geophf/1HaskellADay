    "review": "$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean.",

    "review": "2011 was a great year for Sauternes and this second wine of Rieussec shows great botrytis weight and richness as well as a floral and fruity character. Bitter orange marmalade and honey give this still-youthful wine its sweeter and fruitier side. Drink from 2016.",
