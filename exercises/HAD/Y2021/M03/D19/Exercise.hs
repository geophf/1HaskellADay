@AnecdotesMaths has been publishing a formula for pi, or to approximate pi,
every day this month. I've been retweeting those formulae, because I like pi.

I also like tau, and I also like cake, so there's that.

Take one of those formulae and compute pi to a 'reasonable' degree of accuracy.

Print pi.

pi :: Double -- or some other numerical representation that suits you.
pi = undefined

{-- BONUS -------------------------------------------------------

The above formula is either inaccurate or does not terminate ... or both.

Have a formula that either stops after the nth iteration or stops within a
certain degree of accuracy.
--}

nthPi :: Int -> Double
nthPi n = undefined

piWithin :: Double -> Double
piWithin epsilon = undefined

-- n.b. Today, 3.19 is a 'kinda'-accurate representation of pi? maybe?
